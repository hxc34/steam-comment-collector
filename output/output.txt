Does this mod add a way for super distant people to convert to other religions? Ex: I am playing Asia Expanded and I'd love to convert to Orthodoxy as a Chinese character, is there any way to do that

Comment 2:

up

Comment 3:

@MASTER SKYWALKER Awesome mod, it is unfortunately incompatible with Ketaros' Advanced Court Positions but anyone can fix it, just change the code in the file "missionary_court_positions" (you can find it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\1158310) and change

court_position_category_special

to

court_position_category_learning

Comment 4:

Had such an amazing moment... survived the first catholic crusade with the abbasi people help after securing a jizya contract as jewish.

However time went and I became independent and gamed an alliance with the young adult i left as ruler after being regent and stealing loads of money to jumpstart the israel economy. Managed to get a ton and wanted to prepare for the second crusade inevtible to come as I still havent made the jerusalem kingdom de jure (must be christian to create).

Spent 2 tries on max gold missionary missions and managed to get a minor county north in some slavic states. nearly 50 years later a crusade is declared on me then i realize the entire kingdom has become jewish and is aiding me on the holy war with nearly a 10k stack putting us just above the crusaders in numbers.

Comment 1:

@MASTER SKYWALKER - Apologies for posting this here, but just an FYI that the AGOT page has no Discussion section, despite the latest updates directing us to it.

Don't have a reddit account & didn't want to bug any modders with a fr/pm, so I figured this was the best option to reach out.

Comment 2:

Is is possible to make option which you can choose where to send missionaire? Not random county?

Comment 3:

I love this mod, though I do wish there was a way to pick which realm I wanna send missionaries to. Weird sending missionaries from Ireland to India or Morrowind to Yokuda.

Comment 4:

can you choose the realm to send the missionaries to or is it random? i dont want pagans to die out. id rather help em reform

Comment 5:

Does AI also use this awesome mechanic ?

Comment 6:

Ok so I think it's better that I wait to enjoy the mod in my next game ?
I ? LOVE your mods ?
I would like to share with you this short list of new mods ideas:

1) Council Positions History Function (full list of our past chancellors for example...) It should work like Title History.
2) Rename Houses of:
- Barons
- Bishops and Popes
- Revolts Commanders
- Republics Rulers
- Holy Orders Grand Masters
(Current mods don't do that).
3) Place of Birth note (basing on mothers' location at each characters' birth time, for example)
4) Memories Plus (adding in the memories: wounds in battles, excommunications, positions in the council...)
5) Anniversaries Mechanic (dates to be celebrated...important victories for example)
6 ) Bride Trip Mechanic (bride's trip from her court to the court of her future husband).

Is there something that you like? ?

Comment 7:

not recommended but theoretically yes
just do this in debug
effect trigger_event = { on_action = on_missionary_start }

Comment 8:

Is this mod savegame compatible?

Comment 9:

Could you maybe nerf piety gain from court positions?
In the game, Chief Qadi gives +2% to +10% Monthly Piety, and High Almoner gives +5% to +20% Monthly Piety
In the mod, Head Missionary is +10% to 50% which is a lot, and four Missionaries are +5% to 25%
And maybe add Dynasty Perk Inner Circle effect for salary and revoke costs?

Comment 10:

Would be interesting to see a proper mod regarding this, with not only christian monks, but Norse "priests" aswell converting regions. Maybe that's a thing in this, haven't checked properly, but 99% of the time it's never like that so :P

Comment 1:

sad

Comment 2:

yeah im pretty sure im using the latest version i've resuscribed to both mods a few times and still got that problem

Comment 3:

@pollo, I had the same issue with advanced court and some other mods and it doesnt seems to be a problem of missionaries, but rather advanced court, that dislikes other mods changing the vanilla court positions

Comment 4:

idk are you sure you are on the latest version?

Comment 5:

Hey man, im having a issue, every time I use this mod with advanced court it will push the court positions to the far right, any way to fix this?

Comment 6:

I dont get a notification on the results after I send my missionaries out. Is that normal?

Comment 7:

Addendum: I am just dumb. Low quality just, removes water from existing with ATE.

Comment 8:

Okay update after trouble-shooting; The mod makes the oceans into void-black. I have no idea why, but it does. This being specifically in reference to After the End.

Comment 9:

Wow I was literally just looking for that, good to know.

Comment 10:

oh nice
that was lucky

///////////////////Page 6///////////////
Comment 1:

Update: This mod works for after the end. All of the religions based off of Christianity have Missionaries Encouraged and other religions do not which seems very fitting.

Comment 2:

I'm wondering if this will work for the After the End mod. I know the mod sets missionaries as not allowed by default for modded religions but some religions are technically copies of base game religions. I'll check it myself if no one knows.

Comment 3:

yes and yes
compatible with everything technically but any modded faith will start with missionaries not allowed

Comment 4:

Is this compatible with Catholic Trinity and RICE?

Comment 5:

still works with 1.8.1
will change the number on the launcher soon

Comment 6:

Plz update to 1.8.1

Comment 7:

Does this work with the Pagan religion?

Comment 8:

Can I choose target for missionaries?

Comment 9:

yes but you need a command

Does it work with old saves?

Comment 1:

still works

Comment 2:

probably yea

Comment 3:

is this compatible with Catholic Trinity?

Comment 4:

oh didnt realize there was a decision to take

Comment 5:

at least the head missionary but the more you employ the better your chances
then just use the decision

Comment 6:

so how do i make the missionaries do something? how many do i need?

Comment 7:

Yep sorry it was a different religion mod, this one still works!

Comment 8:

this mod should still work fine
are you sure the incompatibility is coming from this?

Comment 9:

Hey do you plan to update the mod with the new CK3 update? It seems that the new updated faith icon options don't show up when this mod is applied.

Comment 1:

really great mod, i really like it, but i have some suggestions.
1. missionaries should be affected by distance to target province, a Tibetan Buddhist shouldn't be able to randomly convert a European province.
2. target province religion should matter. it should be easier to change within the same religious family (i.e. Ash'ari to Mutazilite) than something very unrelated (i.e. Taoist to reformed African pagan).
3. being able to target which province to send missionaries to would be great, border provinces make the most sense.

Comment 2:

yes but you need to enable debug and run this
effect trigger_event = { on_action = on_missionary_start }

Comment 3:

Save game compatible?

Comment 4:

Ah, sorry for that!

Comment 5:

I did change it
maybe try resubscribing?

Comment 6:

Hey, could you move the missionary position into another (e.g. diplomacy) kategory? Because the special kategory breaks the UI if you have Advanced Court Positions from Ketaros

Comment 5:

Hi there,
I have uploaded a german translation. Just take a look at my workshop

Comment 6:

yea it needs a new save
I think I posted a command somewhere here to get missionaries mid save

Comment 7:

Sorry, using this mod mid-game and I don't see the option so question:

1) Does this mod require a fresh save?

2) Or does it simply require me to create a new faith?

Both options seem like reasonable reasons as to why its not showing up, but I just want to double confirm before I make the assumption.

Comment 8:

Thanks Master. Hm, I have a problem with the new system. I have a decision with missionaries that requires a Head Missionary, but there is no Head Missionary position anymore since the tab was removed. Ideas? I am the HRE emperor, a christian new faith with Missionaries Encouraged. Thanks

///////////////////Page 12///////////////
Comment 1:

I'd rather see them randomly, or let me pick the regions, with different costs, based on conversion costs/duration/local development. The Spaniards and Portuguese didn't send as much missionaries to northern Africa as they did to far away lands.

Comment 2:

Thank you for this. As others have already mentioned, it should be balanced around nearby empires or even your diplomatic range. Still, great mod!

Comment 3:

I kind of like the chaotic rpg of the missionaries - finding Orthodox in far away Indian lands. Would love to be able to select via game rule.

Comment 4:

I think this is the most importanti thing to level up your mod, add a geographic space to missionaries as it was in middle ages.

Then it would be great to add flavour events to this convertion. U can use in middle age history tons and tons of sources and kings convertions

Comment 5:

hmmmm all good points
geographical regions will be added soon

Comment 6:

Your mod is awesome and Base game should have it but at the moment I think it needs something more. Id doenst make any sense honestly.

The choice in your event of the region of the county is meaningfull and at the end strange things happen.

For example from ethiopia I converted a count ind iceland to coptic and I dont know why. In general always conties from the end of the world.

Other times I converted orthodox to coptic and it shouldnt be avalaible for ecumenic. So my tips

1) Add in your event geographic regions, u can use de jure empire (in diplomatic region). For example if Im playing in europe, I choose to send missionaries in Iberia France Germany Britannia and so on.

2) No convertion for ecumenic people.

3) head of faith should have a reoe. Lets think to eastern europe and the struggle between orthodox basileus and catholic pope to convert bulgaria. For example if by event the Pope choose to convert baltic sea, catholic kings should try to send missionaries there

Comment 7:

awesome ilu

Comment 8:

small update:
- moved court positions to special and not it's own tab, mod is now 100% compatible with everything
- updated to 1.7.2
- fixed the female missionaries in male only faiths and vice versa

Comment 9:

>I'm thinking of removing the special missionary tab
thatd be best

Comment 10:

oh yea that's a good point!
will do

///////////////////Page 13///////////////
Comment 1:

why there women missionaries in islam? can u try to change mod according to male/female doctrine chosen in religion?

Comment 2:

is their a option to pick a ruler to try to convert? It picks a random ruler when i do it.

Comment 3:

that is because of mod incompatibilities
I'm thinking of removing the special missionary tab so it doesn't happen anymore

Comment 4:

so for some reason the missionary tab in my courtiers window is pushing off the screen a bit

Comment 5:

Odd; none of the dead ruler's courtiers, kids, or vassals converted. I guess they died before they had a chance to convert anyone else?

Comment 6:

done

Comment 7:

it is an oversight yes
will fix

Comment 8:

I'm sorry if that was asked before: is converting mercenary leaders a bug or a feature? It doesn't seem a good investment at all (it happend with max funds spent), maybe it's possible to limit the options to landed rulers?

Comment 9:

the ruler is picked and checked after the missionaries reach to avoid this
what could've happened is:
- you send missionaries
- missionaries reach the then alive ruler and he converts
- and in the 1-2 years while the missionaries return, the ruler died

Comment 10:

After many failures, I finally succeeded at converting... a dead man! Apparently my religion has power in the afterlife!

I'm guessing the mod picks a character when the mission starts, then doesn't check if they die. Perhaps it could choose a realm instead of a character, then convert the ruler of that realm at the end?

@MASTER thanks a lot I will try that.

Comment 6:

I posted a german Translation in the discussion tab :)

Comment 7:

not without debug (since it's mid game)

in debug mode type:
effect trigger_event = { on_action = on_missionary_start }

Comment 8:

Hey thanks for the update. I have a playtrough (mid game) with More bookmarks but it doesnt seem to work for all existing faiths. You must create a new one to have the doctrine. Is it possible to have it with the existing faith ?

Comment 9:

mod is now compatible with 1.7.0 (I think)
next update I'm aiming to add 2 main things:
- missionary related memories
- extra decision options for sending missionaries (although I'm not sure what to do with it yet, my main idea is making it limited by diplo range)

Comment 10:

When you update hopefully you can give a location to convert instead of a random place. I think i played in a game in Africa but a missionary converted a random region by china lol

///////////////////Page 15///////////////
Comment 1:

Thank you!

Comment 2:

yes I will update soon
stuff is currently in the way but I'll get on it

Comment 3:

update?

Comment 4:

I think it would be fun to allow you to ally the ruler that you just converted, which will make sending missionary more rewarding and impactful!

Comment 5:

it should

Comment 6:

Does it work with sinews of war?

Comment 7:

If any religion mods it TCs approach me I'll make their faith compatible :)

Just need a variable to be set on game start which most mods do nowadays

Comment 8:

For anyone playing this with a total conversion mod - you can easily change the doctrine manually ingame by opening the debug console (look up online how to enable debug mode)
and then using
"remove_doctrine doctrine_missionary_not_allowed"
as well as
"add_doctrine doctrine_missionary_allowed"

Great mod haha! Ill be using it to spread the faith of the Black Serpent (who is def not Sauron) across Harad

Comment 9:

on Christians sending missionaries to other christians, that is actully less anachronistic than you might first think.
The Catholic missionaries sent to "Ireland" springs to mind, the crusade against the heretics in Spain, the competitive missionary work that gave rise to Cyril being sponsored by the byzantines into codifying a written language for the eastern church in direct competition with the Franks... Today even, christians will love to preach to other christians. After all what is worse than a pagan is another monotheist who has a different idea.

Comment 10:

Oh another thing I noticed, was the fact I could send missionaries to Orthodox counties as a Catholic. This feels a bit weird although of course not totally unfeasible. But missionaries to pagan lands makes a lot more sense.

///////////////////Page 16///////////////
Comment 1:

a targeted mission will be available in the future

Comment 2:

oooooo good point
weird it isn't a base game thing

Comment 3:

Since you have already voiced specific realm targets in the future I would propose Hungary as another option, since it was "relatively" quickly inducted into the Christian world after the original conquest of the Carpathian basin (the first Christian king off Hungary ascended to the throne around 1000/1001 AD).

Comment 4:

Hey man! As pormised on the reddit thread I have some feedback:

I love the idea and general implementation of the mod, however a major irk is the fact most of the target choices you can take are random and usually are places that are really far away. I am not sure how feasible it is, but would there be an option to either target the actual attempt in some way (maybe something like the adventure inspiration saying the region the adventurer wants to travel to) or make it weighted heavily towards neighboring pagans?

I like how you made the Scandinavian missionaries decision separate from the rest, but it would be awesome if the general event could also be targeted more heavily in Europe as a European for example (is it possible to bind it to diplomatic range?).

Comment 5:

it is a feature for now but i will give more options soon
basically I needed it so christianity can spread to asia in fallen eagle

Comment 6:

Is it normal for missionaries to be traveling to India and Mongolia as when playing in Europe? It feels kind of weird especially given the fact that there are closer pagans in Europe for them to go to. I just want to know if this is a mod conflict or an intended feature.

Comment 7:

yes

Comment 8:

will the AI do this stuff?

Comment 9:

@whuchurface
Scandinavia already has a decision:)
But I'll add more options for other nations in the future

Comment 10:

@Coach
It should still work if you put it first (if the other court position mod adds other groups, else put it last)

///////////////////Page 17///////////////
Comment 1:

Aw man THANK YOU for making this mod, no more do I have to conquer nations or go through a ellaborate plan to convert the heir to a empire to my religon.

Comment 2:

Could you add in some way of targeting a specific realm? Or perhaps a generic version of the Christianisation of Scandinavia that can flood a de jure empire with missionaries once a certain threshold of conversion has already been met?

Comment 3:

Hi quick question, I suppose this mod wont work with other mods that change the UI of court positions ? I have that 'extended court' mod and 90 other mods, including Trade Route.

Comment 4:

Why would it make sense? Missionaries were present even when America was discovered, and even hundred of years later.

Comment 5:

Only allowing missionaries for reformed faiths would prob make sense

Comment 6:

yes but will all have not allowed missionaries (which might still be historical)

Comment 7:

you know if this will work with the ones RICE added?

Comment 8:

Love the idea! Let's see how good is it in practice. Thank you for the mod!

Comment 9:

this honesty should be in the main game

doctrine_missionary_encouraged, doctrine_missionary_allowed, doctrine_missionary_not_allowed

Comment 1:

BTW, what is the doctrine id script? I've already created my ideal religion and want to use the console to add the missionaries. Thanks in advance.

Comment 2:

Finally, a historical reason the Crusades happened, and now I can do it too!

Comment 3:

@Blagofruit
Yes Catholics get the strongest doctrine

Comment 4:

Hmmmmm
Scandinavia does have its own missionary decision/events since that area was targeted yea

Diplo range makes perfect sense too in this time so I might do that

Comment 5:

*by convert vassals I mean as a potentially more in-depth alternative to the more aggressive "demand conversion" action...

Comment 6:

I know for certain that both secular and clerical leaders in Saxony deliberately targeted Denmark for conversion, but you're right there is little evidence that I'm aware of other catholic leaders (save for the papacy) that actively sought to proselytize foreign realms. As for Islamic secular and religious authorities (especially those in Africa), the profit incentives of enslaving non-muslims and the jizyah tax made them reluctant to convert others, but I'm almost positive there are plenty of examples to the contrary (especially in the steppe).

I think the current system would work well IF restricted to ones diplomatic range or exclusively for neighboring counties/duchies/kindoms/empires (land borders or by a defined amount of naval paths or w/e they're called). I dont know if you wanna get crazy but maybe even convert among special relations (friends, vassals for sure, spouses owning foreign lands, etc.)

Comment 7:

Will missionaries be included in Catholicism or do you have to create a faith?

Comment 8:

;( thanks anyway

Comment 9:

yes sadly

Comment 10:

do i need to start a new game to be able to play with this mod?

///////////////////Page 19///////////////
Comment 1:

@The_Peoples_Vengeance
yes I'll be doing that in the future
I'm still thinking if I should make it per region or character though because I'm not certain if missionaries had a target in the 9th century or if they just tried to convert whoever they can

Comment 2:

@TurtleShroom
1. adding the mod after oriental empires should fix
2. no this mod doesn't edit any religion files
3. well armies take around the same time so I wanted to keep it the same
4. the doctrines are added per religion (except for a few faiths)

Comment 3:

I also back Vengeance on this one

Comment 4:

I second Vengeance's comment. Sending Missionaries to rulers of your choosing was one of my favorite parts of CK2.

Comment 5:

curious if there will be an option in the future to target specific counties/duchies/kingdoms/etc instead of the system in place now which sends missionaries to rather irrelevant areas of the world, i.e. asking me as a norman to convert adherents of bori in hausaland

Comment 6:

1. Editing the UI to add Missionaries in the Council causes conflicts with all Mods that more Council Positions. Chief among these is the Oriental Empires Mod, that adds three (for a total of nine). I would suggest making the Missionaries be assigned in the Minor Titles, where there is a scroll bar.

2. Does this Mod overwrite any religion files? It doesn't actually have to, because there is a way to add Doctrines to Religions BY EVENT .

3. Why five? That'll just paint the Map in a few years. Missionary work in ancient times was difficult, expensive, and far slower.

4. Does this Mod support RL religions added by Mods? Does it modify the religion sub-group, or does it modify the actual, individual faiths, or both (depending on the faith)?

yes

I think the missionary doctrines just generally forbid a temporal head of faith.

How does the Norse decision work if Norse (or Norse - heritage) Asatru are actually dominant in the 1100s ? Is there a peace out for the AI to prevent such from flipping to Christian due to say a random Christian count holding a county in Denmark (which can happen due to the Paradox events that try to swap Asatru to Christian but usually fail in 867 starts due to the Norse/Asatru being .... a tad overpowered I guess is the best way to put it it) ?
